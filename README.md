## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the webpage.
- `css/`: A directory containing the compiled CSS file.
  - `styles.css`: The CSS file generated from the LESS code.
- `less/`: A directory containing the LESS source files.
  - `styles.less`: The LESS file where variables, mixins, and styles are defined.

## Features

- **Variables**: LESS allows the use of variables to store common values such as colors, enabling easy updates and maintenance.
- **Nesting**: LESS supports nesting of rules, which closely follows the HTML structure, making the CSS more readable and maintainable.
- **Mixins**: Reusable pieces of code that can be included in other rules to avoid repetition and ensure consistency.

## How to Use

1. **Install LESS**: Ensure that LESS is installed globally on your system using Node.js:
    ```bash
    npm install -g less
    ```

2. **Compile LESS to CSS**: Navigate to the project directory and compile the LESS file to CSS:
    ```bash
    lessc less/styles.less css/styles.css
    ```

3. **Open `index.html`**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the styled webpage.

## Example

The project includes a simple HTML structure with basic styling applied using LESS. The styles include a background color, font styling, and centered text.

Feel free to explore and modify the LESS file to see how changes are reflected in the compiled CSS and the resulting webpage.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an introduction to using LESS for CSS preprocessing. By leveraging variables, nesting, and mixins, LESS helps streamline and enhance the process of writing CSS, making it more maintainable and scalable.
